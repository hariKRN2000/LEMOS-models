This folder contains the jupyter notebook demonstrating the plotting of the timing diagrams. <br> 
Timing diagrams refer to the plots that show how the duty cycle is varying with time. They are useful to visualize how the controller input changes based on the FL/OD data. <br>
The files used in this folder are: <br>
-- ```bluetooth log files``` : These are the log files that are stored during the experiment. They store all the inputs that were sent to the arduino microcontroller in the LEMOS device by the controller (in the computer). 
-- ```controller files``` : These are the python files used to run the experiments. They can be reffered to identify which well has what kind of control strategy and what is the set point. <br>
-- ```experiment data``` : Contains the experiment data from different control experiments, used to plot the dynamics alongside the duty cycle variations. 
-- ```figures``` : Where the timing diagrams are exported.
