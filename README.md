# LED-Embedded Microplate for Optogenetic Studies (LEMOS)
Experiment run files and Dynamic models used to study the dynamics of optogenetic two component system and develop closed loop control strategies <br>

## Installation: 
To run the files in the repository, clone this repository via git. into your computer using the command:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/hariKRN2000/Gene-Expression-Across-Growth-Stages.git
```
Once cloned, we recommend installing the dependencies in a new virtual environment (with Python version greater than 3.9). <br> 
Example code to set up a virtual environment in desired directory using terminal command: 
```
python -m venv <environment name>
```
And activate the environment using: 
Linux/macOS: Run ```source <environment_name>/bin/activate``` <br>
Windows: Run ```<environment_name>\Scripts\activate.bat``` <br>
This command activates the environment and modifies your shell's path to point to the virtual environment's Python interpreter and pip. <br>

## File Information: 

-- '''growth independent models'''
